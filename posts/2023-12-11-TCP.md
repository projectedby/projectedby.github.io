## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

### Key TCP Concepts

TCP provides a reliable, in-order, byte-stream service to applications.

The application byte-stream is conveyed over the network via TCP segments, with each TCP segment sent as an Internet Protocol (IP) datagram.

TCP reliability consists of detecting packet losses (via sequence numbers) and errors (via per-segment checksums), as well as correction via retransmission.

TCP supports unicast delivery of data. There are anycast applications that can successfully use TCP without modifications, though there is some risk of instability due to changes of lower-layer forwarding behavior.

TCP is connection oriented, though it does not inherently include a liveness detection capability.

Data flow is supported bidirectionally over TCP connections, though applications are free to send data only unidirectionally, if they so choose.

TCP uses port numbers to identify application services and to multiplex distinct flows between hosts.

### Functional Specification

#### Header Format

TCP segments are sent as internet datagrams.

The Internet Protocol (IP) header carries several information fields, including the source and destination host addresses.

A TCP header follows the IP headers, supplying information specific to TCP.

| Field                 | Bits    | Description                  |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| Source Port           | 16 bits | The source port number.      |
| Destination Port      | 16 bits | The destination port number. |
| Sequence Number       | 32 bits | The sequence number of the first data octet in this segment (except when the SYN flag is set). If SYN is set, the sequence number is the initial sequence number (ISN) and the first data octet is ISN + 1. |
| Acknowledgment Number | 32 bits | If the ACK control bit is set, this field contains the value of the next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to receive. Once a connection is established, this is always sent. |
| Data Offset           | 4 bits  | The number of 32 bit words in the TCP header. This indicates where the data begins. The TCP header (even one including options) is an integer multiple of 32 bits long. |
| Reserved              | 4 bits  | A set of control bits reserved for future use. Must be zero in generated segments and must be ignored in received segments if the corresponding future features are not implemented by the sending or receiving host. |
| Control bits          | 1 bit   | The control bits are also known as "flags". Assignment is managed by IANA from the "TCP Header Flags" registry. The currently assigned control bits are CWR, ECE, URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, and FIN. |
| Window                | 16 bits | The number of data octets beginning with the one indicated in the acknowledgment field that the sender of this segment is willing to accept. The window size must be treated as an unsigned number, or else large window sizes will appear like negative windows and TCP will not work. It is recommended that implementations will reserve 32-bit fields for the send and receive window sizes in the connection record and do all window computations with 32 bits. |
| Checksum              | 16 bits | The checksum field is the 16-bit ones' complement of the ones' complement sum of all 16-bit words in the header and text. The checksum computation needs to ensure the 16-bit alignment of the data being summed. If a segment contains an odd number of header and text octets, alignment can be achieved by padding the last octet with zeros on its right to form a 16-bit word for checksum purposes. The pad is not transmitted as part of the segment. While computing the checksum, the checksum field itself is replaced with zeros. The checksum also covers a pseudo-header conceptually prefixed to the TCP header. The pseudo-header is 96 bits for IPv4 and 320 bits for IPv6. Including the pseudo-header in the checksum gives the TCP connection protection against misrouted segments. This information is carried in IP headers and is transferred across the TCP/network interface in the arguments or results of calls by the TCP implementation on the IP layer. |
| Urgent Pointer        | 16 bits | This field communicates the current value of the urgent pointer as a positive offset from the sequence number in this segment. The urgent pointer points to the sequence number of the octet following the urgent data. This field is only to be interpreted in segments with the URG control bit set. |
| Options               | ...     | Options may occupy space at the end of the TCP header and are a multiple of 8 bits in length. All options are included in the checksum. An option may begin on any octet boundary. |
| Data                  | ...     | User data carried by the TCP segment. |
