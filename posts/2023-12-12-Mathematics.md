## Linear Programing

Linear programming uses a mathematical model to describe the problem of concern. The adjective linear means that all the mathematical functions in this model are required to be linear functions. The word programming does not refer here to computer programming; rather, it is essentially a synonym for planning. Thus, linear programming involves the planning of activities to obtain an optimal result, i.e., a result that reaches the specified goal best (according to the mathematical model) among all feasible alternatives.

### PROTOTYPE

To summarize, in the mathematical language of linear programming, the problem is to choose values of $ x\_{1} $ and $ x\_{2} $ so as to

```latex
Maximize Z = 3x_{ 1 } + 5x_{ 2 }
```

subject to the restrictions

```latex
\begin{aligned}
x_{ 1 } \leqq 4
\\
2x_{ 2 } \leqq 12
\\
3x_{ 1 } + 2x_{ 2 } \leqq 18
\end{aligned}
```

and

```latex
x_{ 1 } \geqq 0,\space\space x_{ 2 } \geqq 0
```
